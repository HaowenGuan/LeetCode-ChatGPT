To have fun, he took a piece of paper and wrote out 10 numbers on a single line. After that, Vasya began to write out different ways to put pluses () in the line between certain digits in the line so that the result was a correct arithmetic expression; formally, no two pluses in such a partition can stand together (between any two adjacent pluses there must be at least one digit), and no plus can stand at the beginning or the end of a line. The lesson was long, and Vasya has written all the correct ways to place exactly k pluses in a string of digits. At this point, he got caught having fun by a teacher and he was given the task to calculate the sum of all the resulting arithmetic expressions by the end of the lesson (when calculating the value of an expression the leading zeros should be ignored).

When it is time for the election, each one of the $n$ citizens will arrive in some order to the voting station. There are only two parties to vote for, conveniently named $1$ and $2$. When arriving to the voting station, a person will vote for one of the parties, unless they are a teller. The tellers do not vote, instead they count how many votes each of the two parties has at the time the teller arrives, and if one of the parties has more votes than the other then that party receives one point (if the two parties have the same number of votes, neither of them receives a point). The party with the most points at the end wins. If both parties end up with the same number of points, chaos ensues. As the president of Elecuador representing party $1$, you are worried that the coming election will be the end of your reign. Fortunately, you have a plan to stop this from happening. In one move, it is possible to swap a teller with an adjacent person in the list of arrivals to the voting station. Note that it is not possible to swap two adjacent non-tellers. What is the minimum number of swaps necessary to ensure that party $1$ wins? The minimum number of swaps necessary to ensure that party $1$ wins is 1.\n\n Correct output\n 4\n"]], "3212": [[-2, "type 1 compilation error = expected an indented block (<string>, line 24)"]],

is known for her incredibly high crime rates. The police see no option but to tighten security. They want to install traffic drones at different intersections to observe who\u2019s running on a red light. If a car runs a red light, the drone will chase and stop the car to give the driver an appropriate ticket. The drones are quite stupid, however, and a drone will stop before it comes to the next intersection as it might otherwise lose its way home. The drones are government funded, so the police force would like to buy as many drones as they are allowed to. Being the programmer-go-to for the Basin City Police Department, they ask you to decide, for a given number of drones, whether it is feasible to position exactly this number of drones. If it is possible to position $k$ drones such that no two neighbouring intersections have been assigned a drone, output a single line containing possible.

Answer\n Inputs\n 38 24\n\n Your output\n The impact factor of a scientific journal is a measure reflecting the average number of citations to articles published in science journals. For this task we are using a simplified formula for calculating the impact factor:\\[  rac{\text {Total count of citations received by articles published in the journal}}{\text {Total number of articles published}} \\] Rounding is always performed upwards. For example the impact factor of the \u201cJournal for ore research and time wasting\u201d that published $38$ articles cited $894$ times is $894 / 38 = 23.53$ rounding up to $24$ You are the editor of one scientific journal. You know how many articles you are going to publish and the owners are pushing you to reach a specific impact factor. You are wondering how many scientists you will have to bribe to cite your articles to meet the owners demands. Since money is tight you want to bribe the minimal amount of scientists.
